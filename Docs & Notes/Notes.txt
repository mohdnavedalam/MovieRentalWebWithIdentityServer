// Below code is for overriding the native js dialog box. But it is not working since there is a compatibility issue since the versions of js and bootstrap files
                // are different -------
                //bootbox.confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this customer?", function (result) {
                //    if (result) {
                //        $.ajax({
                //            url: "/api/customers/" + button.attr("data-customer-id"),
                //            method: "DELETE",
                //            success: function () {
                //                button.parents("tr").remove();
                //            }
